# Meshfree Eigenvalues

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the meshfree method results in "A Meshfree Method for Eigenvalues of Differential Operators on Surfaces, Including Steklov Problems", as well as the meshes needed to perform the finite element computations in Subsection 4.4. Please see the cited paper listed under "Citation" for a more detailed description of the method and tests.

## File Names
The test files for each Subsection are names so that testXpY.m corresponds to Subsection X.Y. 

test4p5t7.m contains the tests for all Subsections from 4.5-4.7, except for 4.5.1, which is in test4p5p1.m.
